## How to play?
The snake has to eat to survive. There is a limited time of 5 minutes until the snake looses health if he doesn't eat enough food. The snake has to eat at least 10 mice every 5 minutes to keep his health up or improve it, otherwise it does deteriorate.

The black holes affect you negatively as well. Every time the snake comes in contact with one it looses health points, but if you eat 10 mice in the 5 minutes available then it will improve.

If the snake consumes at least 3 mice in 1 minute and 30 seconds its speed increases. This happens every minute and 30 seconds and it resets after 5 minute.

When the snake eats itself, it dies and you have to restart the game.
